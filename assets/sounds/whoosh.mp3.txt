# This is a placeholder for the whoosh sound effect
# In a real implementation, this would be a WAV or MP3 file
# For now, this serves as a placeholder file structure

# Suggested sound characteristics for whoosh.mp3:
# - Duration: 0.5-1 second
# - Quick, sharp whoosh sound
# - Higher frequency than portal sound
# - Sharp attack, quick decay
# - Could include subtle web-shooting sound elements

echo "Whoosh sound placeholder - replace with actual audio file"
