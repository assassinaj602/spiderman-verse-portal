# This is a placeholder for the portal opening sound effect
# In a real implementation, this would be a WAV or MP3 file
# For now, this serves as a placeholder file structure

# Suggested sound characteristics for portal_open.mp3:
# - Duration: 2-3 seconds
# - Deep, resonant whoosh with electronic undertones
# - Frequency sweep from low to high
# - Some reverb/echo effect to suggest interdimensional travel
# - Volume should start quiet, peak in middle, fade out

echo "Portal sound placeholder - replace with actual audio file"
